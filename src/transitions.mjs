// =============================================================================
//  @tmcut/core — transitions (Roadmap C5)
//  Pure transition operations on plain Timeline DSL v3 objects.
//
//  Overlap model: a transition attaches to the FOLLOWING clip as
//  `transitionIn = { type, duration }` (ticks) and the helper looks up the
//  clip immediately before it. Applying shifts the clip left by `duration`
//  so its head genuinely overlaps the neighbor's tail — the only model with
//  continuous playback on BOTH layers (no position jump at the window
//  edges). Clearing shifts the clip back right by exactly the stored
//  duration, restoring the original cut position. Only the clip carrying
//  the transition moves; later clips on the track stay put (the gap after
//  it widens by the same amount, so re-applying with a new duration is a
//  pure local swap — positions outside the pair never change).
//
//  Lock-aware per the core convention: locked tracks refuse apply/clear
//  with reason 'locked' (a documented extension of the spec's reason
//  union — the core never mutates locked tracks).
